# Task 10: Settings Persistence

## Objective
Implement settings persistence using browser localStorage for web builds and config files for native builds, with proper serialization/deserialization.

## Requirements

### Core Features
- [ ] localStorage implementation for WASM builds
- [ ] Config file implementation for native builds
- [ ] Settings serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Automatic save on settings change
- [ ] Load settings on application startup

### Technical Details
- [ ] Platform-specific storage backends
- [ ] JSON serialization for settings
- [ ] Error handling for storage failures
- [ ] Default settings fallback
- [ ] Settings validation on load

### Storage Strategy
```rust
#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]
// Use web_sys localStorage
#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]
// Use directories crate for config files
```

### Integration Points
- Requires settings model (Task 4)
- Works alongside all UI tasks
- Independent of other menu components

## Acceptance Criteria
- Settings persist between application restarts
- Platform-appropriate storage location
- Graceful handling of storage errors
- Settings validate correctly on load
- Performance impact is negligible

## Implementation Notes
- Use conditional compilation for platform differences
- Consider settings migration for future updates
- Implement atomic writes to prevent corruption
- Test storage size limits (especially localStorage)

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Save/load cycle testing
- [ ] Invalid settings handling
- [ ] Storage failure scenarios
- [ ] Platform-specific storage locations
- [ ] Settings validation edge cases
