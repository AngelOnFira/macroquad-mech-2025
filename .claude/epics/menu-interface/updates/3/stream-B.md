# Stream B: Main.rs Integration

## Scope
Update main function to use AppState instead of GameState directly. Add state-specific update/render routing. Ensure existing game loop logic works when in Game state. Add integration tests.

## Files
- `client/src/main.rs` (primary file to modify)

## Progress

### 2025-09-04 17:15 - Starting Work
- Read task requirements from issue #3
- Analyzed current main.rs structure 
- **WAITING FOR STREAM A**: AppState implementation not yet available
  - `client/src/app_state.rs` does not exist
  - `client/src/lib.rs` does not exist
  - Stream A needs to complete their work before I can proceed

## Current Understanding
- Main.rs currently uses `GameState` directly wrapped in `Arc<Mutex<GameState>>`
- Game loop includes network client, input handling, rendering, and profiling
- Need to replace direct GameState usage with AppState wrapper
- Must ensure existing game functionality remains unchanged when in Game state

## Waiting Status
- Cannot proceed until Stream A creates `app_state.rs` and updates `lib.rs`
- Will monitor for Stream A completion and update status accordingly

## Coordination Notes
- No conflicts anticipated once Stream A completes
- Will need to import AppState from the new module
- Integration should be straightforward wrapper pattern
