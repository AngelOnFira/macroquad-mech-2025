# Stream B: Widget System & Factory

## Scope
Implement widget factory for different setting types, dynamic panel generation, validation system

## Files
- client/src/settings/widgets.rs
- client/src/settings/widget_factory.rs

## Progress
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive widget system implementation
  - Created `SettingWidget` trait with 7 specialized implementations:
    - `BoolWidget`: Checkbox controls for boolean values
    - `IntWidget`/`FloatWidget`: Sliders and drag values with range validation
    - `StringWidget`: Text input with required field validation
    - `EnumWidget`: Dropdown/combo box for option selections
    - `KeyBindingWidget`: Click-to-capture key binding interface
    - `ResolutionWidget`: Custom resolution picker with presets
  
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Dynamic widget factory system
  - `WidgetFactory`: Factory pattern for widget creation based on metadata
  - `SettingDescriptor`: Comprehensive setting metadata system
  - Category and subcategory organization for settings hierarchy
  - Dynamic rendering with `render_category()` and `render_setting()` methods
  
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Validation system
  - Type-specific validation (numeric ranges, required fields, etc.)
  - `ValidationResult` with detailed error messaging
  - Real-time validation feedback integrated with widget rendering
  - Support for custom validation rules via WidgetConfig
  
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Testing and integration
  - 15 comprehensive unit tests covering all widgets and factory methods
  - Full serialization/deserialization support for settings persistence
  - Default game settings with 4 main categories (Graphics, Audio, Controls, Network)
  - Integration-ready API for settings window (Stream A)

## Deliverables
- `client/src/settings/widgets.rs`: Widget implementations and core types
- `client/src/settings/widget_factory.rs`: Factory and setting descriptors  
- `client/src/settings/mod.rs`: Module interface and documentation
- `client/src/lib.rs`: Added settings module to client crate

## Coordination Notes
- Widget system is ready for integration with Stream A's settings window
- All APIs are designed to work with future settings persistence (Task 4)
- Factory pattern allows easy extension of new widget types
- Category system aligns with planned UI hierarchy in Task 6 requirements

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED
All assigned work for Stream B (widget_system) has been completed successfully. 
The widget system provides a robust foundation for the settings UI implementation.
