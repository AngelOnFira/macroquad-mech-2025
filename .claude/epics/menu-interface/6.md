**Epic**: menu-interface  
**Created**: 2025-09-03T18:46:59Z  
**Updated**: 2025-09-04T11:45:58Z  
**GitHub**: https://github.com/AngelOnFira/macroquad-mech-2025/issues/6  
**Status**: planned  
**Priority**: high  
**Effort**: 8 hours  
**Depends On**: [4, 5]  
**Parallel**: false  

## Overview

Implement hierarchical settings UI with category-based organization using egui. This task creates the visual interface for the settings system built in Task 4, integrating it into the main menu structure from Task 5.

## Objectives

- Create hierarchical settings screens with main categories
- Implement tree-based navigation using egui's built-in widgets
- Design responsive layout that works across different screen sizes
- Integrate with existing settings model and persistence
- Provide real-time preview of setting changes where applicable

## Technical Requirements

### Settings Categories Structure
```
Settings/
├── Graphics/
│   ├── Resolution & Display
│   ├── Rendering Quality
│   └── Performance
├── Audio/
│   ├── Volume Controls
│   ├── Audio Quality
│   └── Sound Effects
├── Controls/
│   ├── Keyboard Bindings
│   ├── Mouse Settings
│   └── Controller Support
└── Network/
    ├── Connection Settings
    ├── Server Preferences
    └── Multiplayer Options
```

### Core Components

1. **SettingsWindow** - Main container for settings UI
   ```rust
   pub struct SettingsWindow {
       selected_category: SettingsCategory,
       selected_subcategory: Option<String>,
       settings_model: Arc<RwLock<SettingsModel>>,
       preview_changes: HashMap<String, SettingValue>,
   }
   ```

2. **CategoryTree** - Left panel navigation tree
   - Collapsible category groups
   - Highlighted selection state
   - Keyboard navigation support

3. **SettingsPanel** - Right panel for setting controls
   - Dynamic widget generation based on setting type
   - Real-time validation feedback
   - Apply/Reset/Default buttons

### Widget Types by Setting

- **Boolean**: Checkbox with label
- **Integer**: Slider with text input fallback
- **Float**: Slider with precise text input
- **String**: Text input with validation
- **Enum**: Dropdown/ComboBox selection
- **KeyBinding**: Click-to-capture key input
- **Resolution**: Custom resolution picker

### Integration Points

- Connect to `SettingsModel` from Task 4
- Integrate with `MenuState::Settings` from Task 5
- Use existing camera and rendering systems for previews
- Hook into input system for keybinding capture

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Structure (2 hours)
1. Create `SettingsWindow` struct and basic layout
2. Implement category tree navigation
3. Add empty panels for each category
4. Basic state management for selected category

### Phase 2: Widget System (3 hours)
1. Create widget factory for different setting types
2. Implement dynamic panel generation
3. Add validation and error display
4. Connect to settings model for data binding

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (2 hours)
1. Real-time preview system
2. Apply/Reset/Default button logic
3. Keybinding capture interface
4. Resolution picker with aspect ratio detection

### Phase 4: Polish & Integration (1 hour)
1. Responsive layout adjustments
2. Accessibility improvements
3. Integration testing with main menu
4. Performance optimization for large setting sets

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Settings window opens from main menu
- [ ] All four main categories (Graphics, Audio, Controls, Network) accessible
- [ ] Each category displays relevant subcategories and settings
- [ ] Settings changes persist using existing settings model
- [ ] Apply/Reset/Default buttons work correctly
- [ ] Real-time preview for graphics settings (where safe)
- [ ] Keybinding capture works without conflicts

### UI/UX Requirements
- [ ] Intuitive tree navigation with visual feedback
- [ ] Clear visual separation between categories and settings
- [ ] Responsive layout adapts to different window sizes
- [ ] Consistent spacing and typography
- [ ] Loading states for settings that require validation
- [ ] Error messages for invalid setting values

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Integrates cleanly with existing MenuState enum
- [ ] Uses SettingsModel from Task 4 without modification
- [ ] Follows existing egui patterns and styling
- [ ] Memory efficient with lazy loading of setting panels
- [ ] Thread-safe settings access using Arc<RwLock>

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Settings widget creation and state management
- Category navigation and selection logic
- Setting validation and transformation
- Preview system activation/deactivation

### Integration Tests
- Settings persistence across application restart
- Menu navigation to/from settings
- Real-time preview of graphics changes
- Keybinding conflict detection and resolution

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. Navigate through all categories and subcategories
2. Change various settings and verify persistence
3. Test Apply/Reset/Default functionality
4. Capture new keybindings for different actions
5. Resize window and verify responsive layout
6. Test with invalid setting values (boundary testing)

## Known Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- **Keybinding Conflicts**: Need to detect and warn about conflicting key assignments
- **Real-time Previews**: Graphics changes may require renderer restart
- **Category State**: Managing expanded/collapsed state of category tree
- **Validation Timing**: When to validate and apply setting changes

### UI/UX Challenges
- **Information Density**: Balancing detail with usability
- **Category Organization**: Logical grouping that matches user expectations
- **Feedback Timing**: When to show validation errors without being annoying
- **Navigation Flow**: Smooth transitions between categories

## Dependencies

- **Task 4 (Settings Model)**: Provides the underlying data model and persistence
- **Task 5 (Main Menu)**: Provides the menu framework and navigation structure
- **egui framework**: Tree widgets, layout system, input handling
- **Existing input system**: For keybinding capture integration

## Success Metrics

- Settings can be modified and persist across sessions
- Navigation between categories feels smooth and intuitive
- Setting changes provide immediate visual feedback where appropriate
- No performance impact on main game loop when settings window is closed
- All existing keybindings continue to work after rebinding others

## Future Extensions

- Settings search/filter functionality
- Import/export settings profiles  
- Advanced graphics settings with performance impact estimates
- Controller configuration with visual button mapping
- Network latency testing and server ping display
