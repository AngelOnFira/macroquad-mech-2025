# Task 9: Pause Menu Integration

## Objective
Create an in-game pause overlay system using egui that integrates cleanly with the game loop's pause/resume functionality.

## Requirements

### Core Features
- [ ] In-game pause overlay using egui
- [ ] Game loop pause/resume integration
- [ ] ESC key to toggle pause menu
- [ ] Resume, Settings, Disconnect, Quit options
- [ ] Background dimming/blur effect

### Technical Details
- [ ] Pause state management in GameState
- [ ] Proper input handling (game vs menu)
- [ ] Network pause handling (multiplayer considerations)
- [ ] Frame rate management during pause
- [ ] Clean egui integration without conflicts

### Integration Points
- Requires app state foundation (Task 3)
- Uses main menu patterns (Task 5)
- Should integrate with settings system when available

## Acceptance Criteria
- ESC key pauses game and shows overlay menu
- Game simulation pauses completely during menu
- All menu options function correctly
- Clean transitions between paused and unpaused states
- No input conflicts between game and menu

## Implementation Notes
- Use existing egui integration patterns from main menu
- Ensure pause doesn't break network synchronization
- Consider partial pause (UI only) vs full pause (simulation)
- Test with both keyboard and potential gamepad inputs

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Pause/resume functionality
- [ ] Menu option behaviors
- [ ] Network stability during pause
- [ ] Performance during overlay rendering
- [ ] Input state isolation
