# Task 11: State Transition Logic

## Objective
Implement clean transitions between menu and game states with proper connection flow integration and state management.

## Requirements

### Core Features
- [ ] Menu to game state transitions
- [ ] Game to menu state transitions
- [ ] Connection flow integration
- [ ] State cleanup on transitions
- [ ] Error state handling

### Technical Details
- [ ] AppState transition management
- [ ] Network connection lifecycle
- [ ] Resource cleanup between states
- [ ] Loading state indicators
- [ ] Transition animations/feedback

### State Flow
```
MainMenu -> Connecting -> InGame
InGame -> PauseMenu -> InGame
InGame -> MainMenu (disconnect)
Any -> ErrorState -> MainMenu
```

### Integration Points
- Requires app state foundation (Task 3)
- Conflicts with pause menu (Task 9) - both modify game loop
- Must coordinate with connection handling

## Acceptance Criteria
- Smooth transitions between all states
- Proper resource cleanup on state changes
- Network connections managed correctly
- Error states handled gracefully
- No memory leaks between transitions

## Implementation Notes
- Design for future state additions (lobbies, etc.)
- Handle rapid state changes gracefully
- Ensure network cleanup prevents connection leaks
- Consider transition timing and user feedback

## Conflict Resolution
- Task 9 (Pause Menu) also modifies game loop integration
- Coordinate implementation to avoid conflicts
- May require sequential implementation rather than parallel

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] All state transition paths
- [ ] Resource cleanup verification
- [ ] Network connection lifecycle
- [ ] Error state recovery
- [ ] Rapid transition handling
