# Issue #3 Analysis: App State Extension

## Summary
This task creates the foundation for menu system by wrapping existing GameState in an AppState enum. It's a straightforward refactoring with minimal risk but enables all future menu functionality.

## Work Stream Analysis

### Stream A: Core State Implementation
**Agent**: general-purpose
**Priority**: High (blocking for other streams)
**Files**: 
- `client/src/app_state.rs` (new)
- `client/src/lib.rs` (module declaration)

**Scope**:
- Create AppState enum with MainMenu, Settings, Game(GameState), Paused(GameState)
- Implement state transition methods with validation
- Add StateError enum for error handling
- Add unit tests for state transitions

**Estimated Time**: 1.5 hours

**Dependencies**: None
**Can Start Immediately**: Yes

### Stream B: Main.rs Integration
**Agent**: general-purpose  
**Priority**: Medium (depends on Stream A)
**Files**:
- `client/src/main.rs`

**Scope**:
- Update main function to use AppState instead of GameState directly
- Add state-specific update/render routing
- Ensure existing game loop logic works when in Game state
- Add integration tests

**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

**Dependencies**: Stream A (AppState implementation)
**Can Start Immediately**: No

### Stream C: Testing & Validation
**Agent**: test-runner
**Priority**: Low (validation after implementation)
**Files**:
- Test files and validation scripts

**Scope**:
- Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- Test state transitions work correctly
- Validate memory usage and performance
- Test invalid transition scenarios

**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

**Dependencies**: Streams A & B
**Can Start Immediately**: No

## Parallel Execution Plan

1. **Start Stream A immediately** - Core implementation has no dependencies
2. **Stream B waits** for Stream A completion - needs AppState to exist
3. **Stream C waits** for both A & B - validation phase

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Wrapper pattern around existing functionality
- **Main Risk**: Integration issues with main.rs game loop
- **Mitigation**: Preserve all existing GameState behavior exactly

## Success Criteria
1. AppState enum created with all required states
2. State transitions work with proper validation
3. Main.rs successfully uses AppState wrapper
4. All existing tests pass
5. No performance regression
