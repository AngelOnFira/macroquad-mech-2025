# PRD: Menu Interface

## Executive Summary

Create a terminal-inspired, keyboard-driven menu interface system for Mech Battle Arena that enables player testing and provides expected game navigation. The system will handle main menu, pause menu, and settings screens while establishing a reusable framework for future UI needs (inventory, station controls). Focus on browser deployment with WASD navigation and a retro-futuristic aesthetic reminiscent of spaceship terminals.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:** The game lacks essential menu interfaces that players expect for basic navigation, settings configuration, and game control. This prevents effective playtesting with friends and creates barriers to user adoption.

**Why Now:** The game is ready for friend testing and GitHub Pages distribution, requiring polished entry points and configuration options that feel intuitive to players while maintaining the game's mech-operation theme.

**Impact:** Without proper menus, the game appears unfinished and lacks accessibility for new players who need familiar navigation patterns and settings control.

// Proposed structure
pub mod menu {
    pub mod components;     // Button, Panel, List, etc.
    pub mod scenes;         // MainMenu, Settings, Pause
    pub mod state;          // MenuState management
    pub mod theme;          // Terminal styling
    pub mod framework;      // Reusable abstractions
}
```
