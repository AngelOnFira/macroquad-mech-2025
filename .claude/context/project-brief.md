# Project Brief

## Project Summary

**Mech Battle Arena** is a multiplayer web game where teams control giant mechs from the inside, combining real-time strategy with cooperative multiplayer mechanics. Players navigate detailed mech interiors, operate various stations (weapons, shields, engines), and engage in team-versus-team combat while collecting resources for upgrades.

## What It Does

### Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Team Formation:** Players join Red or Blue teams with automatic balancing
2. **Mech Operation:** Navigate 3-floor mech interiors with multiple operational stations  
3. **Cooperative Control:** Multiple players control different aspects of the same mech
4. **Combat Engagement:** Real-time battles between opposing team mechs
5. **Resource Management:** Collect 4 resource types for mech upgrades and repairs
6. **Victory Conditions:** Eliminate opposing team through coordinated tactical gameplay

### Key Mechanics
- **Interior Navigation:** WASD movement through detailed mech layouts
- **Station Control:** Weapons (laser/projectile), shields, engines, specialized systems
- **Vision System:** Line-of-sight mechanics with fog of war and window transparency  
- **Resource Collection:** Strategic resource gathering for team advantages
- **Real-time Coordination:** Voice and in-game communication for team tactics

## Why It Exists

### Problem Statement
Most multiplayer combat games focus on individual performance rather than genuine team coordination. Traditional mech games emphasize external combat rather than the collaborative operation of complex machinery from within.

### Solution Approach
**Mech Battle Arena** addresses this by:
- **Forcing Cooperation:** Individual success requires team coordination
- **Interior Focus:** Unique perspective of operating mechs from inside rather than piloting from external view
- **Role Specialization:** Each player has distinct responsibilities that matter to team success
- **Accessible Multiplayer:** Browser-based play removes installation barriers

### Market Differentiation
- **Cross-platform accessibility** via native desktop + web browser support
- **Hybrid tile system** optimizing performance for complex interior environments
- **Cooperative mech operation** rather than individual mech piloting
- **Real-time team coordination** as core gameplay mechanic

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- ‚úÖ **Cross-platform delivery** - Native Windows/Mac/Linux + web browser
- ‚úÖ **Real-time multiplayer** - Sub-100ms latency for responsive gameplay
- ‚úÖ **Scalable architecture** - Support 10+ concurrent players per battle
- ‚úÖ **Performance optimization** - 60fps on modern hardware, acceptable web performance

### Gameplay Success  
- üîÑ **Team coordination** - Players effectively communicate and coordinate roles
- üîÑ **Replayability** - Varied strategies and outcomes encourage multiple sessions
- ‚è≥ **Learning curve** - New players become effective within 2-3 battles
- ‚è≥ **Retention** - 60%+ player return rate within 24 hours

### Product Success
- ‚è≥ **User adoption** - Sustainable player base for consistent multiplayer matches
- ‚è≥ **Platform balance** - Healthy mix of native and web browser users  
- ‚è≥ **Community engagement** - Active player feedback and community growth
- ‚è≥ **Technical stability** - 95%+ successful connections and battle completions

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Core multiplayer mechanics** - Real-time team coordination and combat
- **Mech interior systems** - 3-floor navigation with multiple station types
- **Cross-platform clients** - Native desktop and WebAssembly browser versions
- **Resource and upgrade systems** - Material collection and mech improvements
- **Vision and fog mechanics** - Line-of-sight system with tactical implications
- **Development infrastructure** - Build automation, testing, and deployment

### Out of Scope  
- **Single-player campaign** - Focus exclusively on multiplayer experience
- **Mobile native apps** - Web browser support sufficient for mobile
- **Advanced AI opponents** - Basic AI for development/testing only
- **Extensive customization** - Standardized mechs and loadouts initially
- **Monetization systems** - Free-to-play focus without payment systems

### Future Considerations
- **Multiple mech types** - Different chassis with unique capabilities
- **Environmental hazards** - Dynamic battlefield elements
- **Spectator and replay systems** - Observation and analysis tools
- **Tournament and ranking** - Competitive play infrastructure

## Key Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Deliver working multiplayer** - Stable real-time team coordination
2. **Cross-platform accessibility** - Native performance, web convenience  
3. **Engaging cooperation** - Meaningful teamwork requirements
4. **Technical innovation** - Hybrid tile system for performance + flexibility

### Secondary Objectives  
1. **Community building** - Foster engaged player community
2. **Performance optimization** - Smooth experience across hardware ranges
3. **Accessibility features** - Broad player base support
4. **Development workflow** - Efficient iteration and deployment processes

## Project Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **WASM limitations** - No wasm-bindgen dependencies due to Macroquad conflicts
- **Browser performance** - WebAssembly performance limitations vs native
- **Network architecture** - JSON over WebSocket protocol constraints
- **Single-threaded client** - Macroquad single-thread requirement

### Resource Constraints
- **Development timeline** - Iterative development with working systems priority
- **Platform support** - Focus on major desktop platforms + modern browsers
- **Feature complexity** - Balance depth with development speed
- **Performance targets** - Optimize for modern hardware, graceful degradation

### Design Constraints
- **Cooperative requirement** - All mechanics must encourage team play
- **Interior focus** - Maintain inside-mech perspective throughout
- **Real-time requirement** - All interactions must feel responsive
- **Cross-platform parity** - Feature consistency across native/web versions

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **WebSocket reliability** - Network interruption handling
- **WASM performance** - Browser performance vs expectations  
- **Cross-platform consistency** - Feature parity maintenance
- **Scalability limits** - Player capacity constraints

### Product Risks
- **Learning curve** - Complexity overwhelming casual players
- **Team coordination** - Difficulty finding cooperative players
- **Platform adoption** - Web vs native user distribution
- **Competition** - Similar games capturing audience

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental delivery** - Working systems at each development phase
- **Performance monitoring** - Real-time metrics and optimization
- **User testing** - Regular feedback integration and iteration
- **Community building** - Active player engagement and feedback channels
