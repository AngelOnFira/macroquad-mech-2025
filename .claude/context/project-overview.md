# Project Overview

## High-Level Summary

**Mech Battle Arena** is a real-time multiplayer strategy game built with Rust, featuring team-based mech warfare from an interior perspective. Players cooperatively operate giant mechs by controlling different stations (weapons, shields, engines) while engaging in tactical combat against opposing teams.

## Current Feature Set

### âœ… Implemented Core Features

- **Automatic team balancing** - Red vs Blue team assignment
- **Concurrent player support** - Multiple players per mech, multiple battles
- **Connection resilience** - Reconnection handling and error recovery

#### Game World System  
- **Hybrid tile-entity system** - 90% static tiles, 10% dynamic entities for optimal performance
- **3-floor mech interiors** - Detailed interior layouts with multiple levels
- **Vision system** - Line-of-sight raycasting with fog of war mechanics
- **Window transparency** - Tactical visibility through mech windows
- **Coordinate abstractions** - Type-safe WorldPos, TilePos, ScreenPos conversions

#### Player Interaction
- **WASD movement** - Continuous movement over tile-based world
- **Station control** - Interactive mech operation stations
