# Project Progress

## Current Status

**Repository:** git@github.com:AngelOnFira/macroquad-mech-2025.git  
**Branch:** main  
**Status:** Clean working tree, up to date with origin  
**Last Activity:** September 3, 2025

## Recent Development Activity

### Latest Commits (Last 10)
- `a6030b8` - Claude file update
- `e012d83` - claude pm  
- `6eb67d2` - Fix camera offset calculation in grass background rendering to correctly reflect camera position
- `8564d4b` - Enhance debug overlay with elapsed time tracking and FPS smoothing; update rendering to conditionally use vision system based on fog settings. Remove debug info from world rendering, now displayed in the debug overlay
- `af594dd` - Initial egui debugging
- `c0cb22b` - Add simple egui
- `850c6c6` - Change math to abstractions
- `bbb2283` - Put logging on pause
- `f98583f` - Working tracing
- `792ec60` - Formatting

### Current Development Focus

**Rendering System Improvements:**
- Camera offset calculations have been fixed for grass background rendering
- Debug overlay enhanced with elapsed time tracking and FPS smoothing
- Vision system integration with fog settings
- Math abstractions implementation completed

**Debug Infrastructure:**
- egui integration for debugging interface
- Tracing system implemented and working
- Debug overlay refactored to consolidate debug information

## Completed Work

### Core Systems
- ✅ Hybrid tile-entity system implementation
- ✅ WebSocket networking (native and WASM)
- ✅ Multiplayer game server with Axum
- ✅ Vision system with raycasting
- ✅ Camera and rendering abstractions
- ✅ Math utilities and coordinate systems
- ✅ DevTabs development environment setup

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Rust workspace configuration with 5 crates
- ✅ WASM build pipeline
- ✅ Cross-platform client (native + web)
- ✅ Automated build and development scripts
- ✅ Debug profiling and tracing

## Current Challenges & Issues

### Recent Fixes
- Camera offset calculation issues resolved
- Debug information consolidation completed
- Math abstraction migration finished

### Outstanding Items
- No critical blockers identified in current state
- Working tree is clean with no uncommitted changes

## Immediate Next Steps

### Development Priorities
1. **Feature Development**: Continue building game mechanics
2. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize based on tracing data
3. **Testing**: Expand multiplayer testing scenarios
4. **Documentation**: Keep development guides current

### Technical Debt
- Monitor for any regressions from recent camera fixes
- Evaluate egui integration completeness
- Assess tracing system performance impact

## Project Health Indicators

**✅ Build Status**: All builds passing  
**✅ Code Quality**: Recent abstractions and cleanup completed  
**✅ Development Workflow**: DevTabs and automated scripts functional  
**✅ Version Control**: Clean working tree, regular commits  
**✅ Documentation**: CLAUDE.md and development guides current  

## Resource Status

**Logs Directory**: Active logging in `logs/` directory  
**Build Artifacts**: Target directory maintained at ~69MB  
**Dependencies**: Cargo.lock current, no known conflicts  
**Development Tools**: Just, DevTabs, tracing all operational
