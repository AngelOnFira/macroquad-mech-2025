# AI Players Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for AI players in Mech Battle Arena. The goal is to create AI teammates that can cooperatively operate mechs alongside human players, simulating realistic player behavior and teamwork.

## Core Concepts

### AI Player Types

1. **Pilot AI** - Specializes in mech movement and positioning
   - Operates the Engine station
   - Avoids obstacles and enemy fire
   - Positions mech strategically for combat

2. **Gunner AI** - Focuses on weapon systems
   - Operates Laser or Projectile weapon stations
   - Targets enemy mechs effectively
   - Coordinates fire with pilot movement

3. **Engineer AI** - Maintains mech systems
   - Operates Repair, Shield, and Upgrade stations
   - Prioritizes repairs when health is low
   - Manages resource allocation for upgrades

4. **Scavenger AI** - Resource collection specialist
   - Exits mech to collect resources
   - Returns resources to mech storage
   - Avoids enemy mechs while outside

## Implementation Architecture

### AI State Machine

Each AI player will have a hierarchical state machine:

```
IDLE
├── SEEKING_TASK
│   ├── FIND_EMPTY_STATION
│   ├── FIND_RESOURCES
│   └── FIND_OBJECTIVE
├── MOVING_TO_TARGET
│   ├── PATHFINDING
│   └── AVOIDING_DANGER
├── OPERATING_STATION
│   ├── ENGINE_CONTROL
│   ├── WEAPON_CONTROL
│   ├── REPAIR_CONTROL
│   └── UPGRADE_CONTROL
└── RESOURCE_GATHERING
    ├── SEARCHING
    ├── COLLECTING
    └── RETURNING
```

### Decision Making System

AI decisions will be based on:

1. **Role Priority** - Each AI type has different priorities
2. **Mech State** - Health, shields, resources available
3. **Team Coordination** - Avoid duplicating tasks
4. **Threat Assessment** - Enemy proximity and danger level

### Communication System

AI players will simulate communication by:
- Broadcasting intentions (e.g., "Moving north", "Engaging enemy")
- Warning teammates of dangers
- Requesting assistance when needed

## Technical Implementation

### Server-Side AI

All AI logic runs on the server to:
- Prevent cheating
- Ensure consistency
- Reduce client computational load

### AI Player Structure

```rust
pub struct AIPlayer {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub name: String,
    pub team: TeamId,
    pub role: AIRole,
    pub state: AIState,
    pub current_goal: Option<AIGoal>,
    pub path: Option<Vec<TilePos>>,
    pub reaction_time: f32, // Simulates human reaction delay
}

pub enum AIRole {
    Pilot,
    Gunner,
    Engineer,
    Scavenger,
}

pub enum AIState {
    Idle,
    SeekingTask,
    MovingToTarget,
    OperatingStation(Uuid),
    GatheringResources,
}
```

### Pathfinding

- Use A* algorithm for navigation
- Account for mech movement when planning paths
- Update paths dynamically when obstacles appear

### Human-like Behavior

To make AI feel more human:
- Add reaction delays (100-300ms)
- Occasional mistakes (5% error rate)
- Varying skill levels (accuracy, decision speed)
- Personality traits (aggressive, cautious, etc.)

## Gameplay Integration

### Mixed Teams

- Human players can specify how many AI teammates they want
- AI automatically fills empty stations
- AI yields stations to human players who approach

### Difficulty Levels

1. **Easy** - Slower reactions, basic strategies
2. **Normal** - Average human-like performance
3. **Hard** - Optimal decisions, fast reactions
4. **Adaptive** - Adjusts to match human teammates

### AI Behavior Examples

**Pilot AI:**
- Keeps mech at optimal combat range
- Dodges incoming projectiles
- Positions for teammate shots

**Gunner AI:**
- Leads targets based on movement
- Prioritizes damaged enemies
- Conserves ammo when needed

**Engineer AI:**
- Repairs at 50% health threshold
- Upgrades based on team strategy
- Manages shield timing

**Scavenger AI:**
- Collects nearest resources first
- Returns when carrying capacity full
- Alerts team to resource locations

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic AI Framework
- AI player creation and management
- Basic state machine
- Simple movement to stations

### Phase 2: Role-Specific Behaviors
- Implement each AI role
- Basic decision making
- Station operation logic

### Phase 3: Pathfinding & Navigation
- A* pathfinding implementation
- Obstacle avoidance
- Dynamic path updates

### Phase 4: Team Coordination
- Communication system
- Cooperative strategies
- Task distribution

### Phase 5: Polish & Tuning
- Human-like delays and errors
- Personality system
- Difficulty balancing

## Performance Considerations

- Limit AI updates to 10Hz (vs 30Hz game loop)
- Use spatial partitioning for nearby entity queries
- Cache pathfinding results when possible
- Limit simultaneous AI calculations

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning for strategy improvement
- Voice line system for AI communication
- Spectator mode to watch AI teams battle
- AI tournaments and leaderboards
