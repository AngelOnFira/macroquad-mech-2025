# WASM Build Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing log imports in client/src/main.rs
- **Problem**: Using `info!` and `error!` macros without importing them
- **Fix**: Added `use log::{info, error};`

### 2. UUID dependency conflict
- **Problem**: `Uuid::new_v4()` requires v4 feature which conflicts with WASM
- **Fix**: 
  - Created conditional dependencies in shared/Cargo.toml
  - Added uuid_gen helper module for platform-specific UUID generation
  - Made object_pool module non-WASM only

### 3. Justfile improvements
- **Updated check-all**: Now includes WASM build checking
- **Updated check-wasm**: Uses proper flags for client WASM builds
- **Updated release-web**: 
  - Checks for WASM target installation
  - Falls back to cargo if Trunk not available
  - Provides helpful messages
- **Updated ci**: Uses check-all to include WASM validation

## Build Commands

### Development
```bash
# Check everything including WASM
just check-all

# Build native components
just build

# Build WASM release
just release-web

# Run full CI pipeline
just ci
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive WASM test
chmod +x test_wasm_complete.sh
./test_wasm_complete.sh

# Check specific WASM build
cd client && cargo check --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --no-default-features

# Build WASM release
cd client && cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release --no-default-features
```

## Expected Behavior

1. **Native builds**: Full UUID generation support
2. **WASM builds**: 
   - Can deserialize UUIDs from server
   - Cannot generate new UUIDs (will panic if attempted)
   - Smaller binary size without unnecessary dependencies

## Trunk Integration

For the best development experience:
```bash
# Install Trunk
cargo install trunk

# Run development server with hot reload
just trunk

# Build optimized release
just release-web
```

Without Trunk, the build will use cargo directly and produce a raw .wasm file that needs manual integration.
